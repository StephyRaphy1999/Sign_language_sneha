                        <p> Communication is the only medium by which we can share our thoughts but for a person with disability (deaf and dumb) it would be difficult to communicate with a normal person.   So a person who lacks hearing and speaking ability cannot stand in race with normal person. It is also difficult for a normal person who doesnâ€™t have any knowledge about sign language to interact with those who have hearing disabilities. Therefore, our project aims to overcome these social difficulties in order to help the physically disabled people. 
                           Although, there have been many existing projects done to convert sign language to text/audio a system that converts audio to sign language have been rarely developed. So the main aim of our project is to introduce a system that recognize various human voice pulses and deliver information to disabled people in sign language symbols. 
                           This is a machine learning (ML) based project. This system take audio as input, convert this audio recording message into text and display the relevant Indian sign language image or GIFs which are predefined. This deep learning application in python also recognizes gestures in real-time on a webcam. The user is allowed to write a word on screen which act as virtual board using an object (here we use cap of bottle in this case). These words are connected to make meaningful sentences. This added feature helps the disabled people to communicate back to normal people even without the use of sign language.
